# Problem 1

``` r
# load data
data("early_january_weather")
ejw_df <- early_january_weather
```

The variables in this early_january_weather dataset are origin, year,
month, day, hour, temp, dewp, hunid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust,
precip, pressure, visib, and time_hour. It has 358 rows and 15 columns.
The mean temperature is 39.5821229

``` r
# create a scatterplot
ggplot(ejw_df, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp)) + geom_point(aes(colour = humid))
```

The temperature data in this figure show periodic fluctuations,
consistent with the daily pattern of temperature changes. In addition,
the overall trend of the temperature is upward, indicating that the
weather gradually warmed over these days. During a certain period, the
humidity was higher, which may indicate precipitation.

# Problem 2

``` r
df1 = 
  tibble(
    random_samp = rnorm(10),
    greater_0 = random_samp > 0,
    char_vec = sample(letters, 10, replace = TRUE),
    factor_vec = factor(sample(c("A", "B", "C"), 10, replace = TRUE))
  )
```

Try to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe: The mean of the
random sample is -0.5067494, the mean of the logical vector is 0.1. The
other two do not work because they are not numeric variables.

``` r
# convert variables to numeric
num_logical <- as.numeric(df1$greater_0)
num_char <- as.numeric(df1$char_vec) 
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
num_factor <- as.numeric(df1$factor_vec) 

num_logical
```

    ##  [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0

``` r
num_char
```

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
num_factor
```

    ##  [1] 3 2 2 3 2 3 1 3 2 2

The logic vector is turned to numeric by converting True to 1 and False
to 0. The factor vector is turned by labeling factors as numbers. Yet we
cannot convert arbitrary letters to numbers directly.
